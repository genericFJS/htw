Use the USB cable to connect the headset with your computer.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{src/inst_connect}
\end{center}
\caption[Connecting the \emph{\pokeT{} reality gear} to your Computer]{Connecting the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} to your Computer}
\label{gear_connect}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Put the headset plug (the thick end of the USB connection cable) into the USB port of the headset (figure \ref{gear_parts}: 3.).
\item Insert both USB plugs into your computer. Keep in mind that both the power and USB-data plug have to be connected to the USB ports of your computer for the headset to function (figure \ref{gear_connect}).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Installing the software}
\label{installSoftware}
Your computer should detect the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} and install the software via \emph{Plug and Play}. 

Please follow these steps, if your computer does not detect the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} automatically:
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{src/inst_install}
\end{center}
\caption[Installing the \emph{\pokeT{} reality gear} software]{Installing the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} software}
\label{gear_install}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Visit our Website \emph{pokemonreality.com} to download the \poke{} setup software. 
%Note: You need to register on our page before you can download the software. Please use the username and password provided in the package.
%\item Make sure you have an internet connection before you start with the installation. The setup wizard will guide through the installation step by step so that you do not make any mistake. 
\item Launch the \poke{} setup wizard and click 'next' (figure \ref{gear_install}).
\item Click 'install' to go ahead with the installation.
\item After the installation is finished please restart your computer. 
\item The \emph{\poke{} reality gear} is now ready to use with your computer.
\end{enumerate}

Please note, that the \emph{\poke{} reality game} is installed alongside with the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} software.

\subsection{Putting the Headset on}
The \emph{\poke{} reality gear} should be placed properly on your head during use:
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{src/inst_gear3}
\end{center}
\caption]{The cable route of the headset}
\label{gear_cable}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Make sure the straps are connected to the headset (figure \ref{gear_parts}: 2.)
\item Hold the headset in front of your head so that the eyes are on the same level with the lenses.
\item Now slide the straps to the back of your head and fasten them until the headset rests comfortably on your head. Make sure it fits perfectly and is neither not too tight or too loose.
\item Regularly check the headset's fit during usage to avoid dangerous pressure points.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Calibrating the interpupillary distance (IPD)}

Before using the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} you have to calibrate the interpupilarry distance (IPD), the distance between the center of the pupils of your eyes.

The \emph{\poke{} reality gear} has a calibration software to measure your IPD:
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{src/inst_install3}
\end{center}
\caption[Configuring the \emph{\pokeT{} reality gear} software]{Configuring the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} software}
\label{gear_ipd}
\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Start the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} software from your computer.
\item Go to the main menu and click 'vr\_calibration': The calibration screen(figure \ref{gear_ipd}) will open.
\item Put the headset on.
\item Follow the instructions visible on the headset screens.

The picture is expected to be blurry at first. At the end of the calibration the picture should be perfectly sharp.

If the picture is still blurry after the calibration try the following steps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Restart the calibration process through the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} software.
\item Manually adjust the IPD settings with options and sliders provided by the calibration screen.
\item Clean the lenses of the headset (see section \ref{cleaningLenses}) and retry the calibration.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection[Using the \emph{\pokeT{} reality gear}]{Using the \emph{\poke{} reality gear}}

You can operate the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} with the built-in tracking feature by using your hands to control the virtual surroundings. Just use your fingers to point and click on menu items or other interactive forms in the virtual world.

Since you can not see your actual hands with the headset strapped to your head, a digital representation is stimulated in the virtual reality. If you have activated the neuro-stimulators, you will have additional sensory input while interaction with the virtual reality.

\subsection{The neuro-stimulators}

To use the neuro-stimulators, activate the on/off switch an the left side of your headset (figure \ref{gear_parts}: 1.). 

Using the neuro-stimulators for the first time may result in a brief period of dizziness and lightheadedness. If you feel dizzy or uncomfortable for a longer than three minutes, switch the neuro-stimulators off.

\section[Cleaning the \emph{\pokeT{} reality gear}]{Cleaning the \emph{\poke{} reality gear}}

Use the included cleaning cloth to clean the \emph{\poke{} reality gear} and follow these instructions:

\begin{itemize}
\item Do not use any cleaning liquid for cleaning the headset, only use water. Some liquids with aggressive chemicals may cause damage to the headset.
\label{cleaningLenses}
\item You may use glass cleaner to clean the lenses. Wipe in circular motion without scratching the lenses.
\end{itemize}

\section{Exploring}

If you followed the instructions in section \ref{gameStart} you should have already explored your room. Just take the final step through the door and explore the \poke{} world.

\section[\pokeT{} battles]{\poke{} battles}
\poke{} battles happen if you encounter wild \poke{} or a \poke{} trainer who wants to fight. The battle screen will open automatically and prompt you to chose a \poke{} with which you want to fight the opponent.

After you have chosen the battlefield is shown(figure \ref{battle}). 
\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{src/interface3}
\end{center}
\caption{The battlefield}
\label{battle}
\end{figure}

By using the projected controls (not visible in the picture) you can take the following actions to choose what do in your turn:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select "Fight" to choose an offensive or defensive action for your \poke{} to execute.
\item Select "Item" to use a special item from the inventory to buff the fighting \poke{}.
\item Select "Pokémon" to exchange the fighting \poke{} for a different \poke{} from your team.
\item Select "Run" to retreat from the battle.
\end{enumerate}
After the selection, both your action an the action of your opponent will be executed.

These turns are repeated until the fight is over. 

\section[Catching \pokeT{}]{Catching \poke{}}

If you want to catch a \poke{} simply select "Item" during one of your turns and choose a Pokéball to use. Remember, that you may only try to catch a wild \poke{} -- the \poke{} of other trainers are off limits.
