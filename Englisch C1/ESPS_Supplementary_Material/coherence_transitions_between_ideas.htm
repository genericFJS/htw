<p><span class="firstwords">The most convincing ideas in the world,</span>
 expressed in the most beautiful sentences, will move no one unless 
those ideas are properly connected. Unless readers can move easily from 
one thought to another, they will surely find something else to read or 
turn on the television. </p><p>







Providing transitions between ideas is largely a matter of attitude. You
 must never assume that your readers know what you know. In fact, it's a
 good idea to assume not only that your readers need all the information
 that you have and need to know how you arrived at the point you're at, 
but also that they are not quite as quick as you are. You might be able 
to leap from one side of the stream to the other; believe that your 
readers need some stepping stones and be sure to place them in readily 
accessible and visible spots.</p><p>







There are four basic mechanical considerations in providing transitions 
between ideas: using transitional expressions, repeating key words and 
phrases, using pronoun reference, and using parallel form.</p><p>





<a name="transitions"></a><a name="transition"></a><a name="transitional_tags">

</a></p><h2><a name="transitional_tags">USING TRANSITIONAL TAGS</a></h2><a name="transitional_tags">

<p>Transitional tags run the gamut from the most simple &#8212; the little conjunctions: <i>and, but, nor, for, yet, or,</i> (and sometimes) <i>so</i> &#8212; to more complex signals that ideas are somehow connected &#8212; the conjunctive adverbs and transitional expressions such as <i>however, moreover, nevertheless, on the other hand</i>.</p><p>



<table class="shadow" width="350" bgcolor="#FOFFFF" border="4" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr><td><span class="table">For additional information on conjunctions, click <a href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/conjunctions.htm"><b>HERE</b></a>.</span></td></tr></tbody></table>


</p><p>The use of the little conjunctions &#8212; especially <i>and</i> and <i>but</i>
 &#8212; comes naturally for most writers. However, the question whether one 
can begin a sentence with a small conjunction often arises. Isn't the 
conjunction at the beginning of the sentence a sign that the sentence 
should have been connected to the prior sentence? Well, sometimes, yes. 
But often the initial  conjunction calls attention to the sentence in an
 effective way, and that's just what you want.  Over-used, beginning a 
sentence with a conjunction can be distracting, but the device can add a
 refreshing dash to a sentence and speed the narrative flow of your 
text. Restrictions against beginning a sentence with <i>and</i> or <i>but</i>
 are based on shaky grammatical foundations; some of the most 
influential writers in the language have been happily ignoring such 
restrictions for centuries.*</p><p>







</p><p>Here is a chart of the transitional devices (also called <b>conjunctive adverbs</b> or <b>adverbial conjunctions</b>) accompanied with a simplified definition of function (note that some devices appear with more than one definition):</p>

<img alt="red light" src="coherence%20transitions%20between%20ideas-Dateien/light.gif" align="left" height="142" hspace="3" width="64"><p><span style="font-size: 120%; color=" darkred";="" font-family:="" arial,="" verdana,="" geneva;="" font-weight:="" bold;"="">A word of caution:</span>
 Do not interlard your text with transitional expressions merely because
 you know these devices connect ideas. They must appear, naturally, 
where they belong, or they'll stick like a fishbone in your reader's 
craw. (For that same reason, there is no point in trying to <i>memorize</i>
 this vast list.) On the other hand, if you can read your entire essay 
and discover none of these transitional devices, then you must wonder 
what, if anything, <i>is</i> holding your ideas together. Practice by  inserting a tentative <i>however, nevertheless, consequently</i>. Reread the essay later to see if these words provide the glue you needed at those points.</p><p>


</p><h2>Repetition of Key Words and Phrases</h2>




<p>The ability to connect ideas by means of repetition of key words and 
phrases sometimes meets a natural resistance based on the fear of being 
repetitive. We've been trained to loathe redundancy. Now we must learn 
that catching a word or phrase that's important to a reader's 
comprehension of a piece and replaying that word or phrase creates a 
musical motif in that reader's head. Unless it is overworked and 
obtrusive, repetition lends itself to a sense of coherence (or at least 
to the illusion of coherence). Remember Lincoln's advice:</p>
<blockquote>
You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people 
some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.</blockquote>



<p>In fact, you can't forget Lincoln's advice, because it has become part of the music of our language. </p><p>



Remember to use this device to link paragraphs as well as sentences. </p><p> 

</p><h2>Pronoun Reference</h2>




<p>Pronouns quite naturally connect ideas because pronouns almost always
 refer the reader to something earlier in the text. I cannot say "This 
is true because . . ." without causing the reader to consider what 
"this" could mean. Thus, the pronoun causes the reader to sum up, 
quickly and subconsciously, what was said before (what <i>this</i> is) before going on to the <i>because</i> part of my reasoning.</p><p>



We should hardly need to add, however, that it must always be perfectly 
clear what a pronoun refers to. If my reader cannot instantly know what <i>this</i> is, then my sentence is ambiguous and misleading. Also, do not rely on unclear pronoun references to avoid responsibility: "<u>They</u> say that . . ."
</p><p>

</p><h2>Parallelism</h2>




</a><p><a name="transitional_tags">Music in prose is often the result of
 parallelism, the deliberate repetition of larger structures of phrases,
 even clauses and whole sentences. We urge you to read the Guide's 
section on </a><a href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/parallelism.htm"><b>Parallelism</b></a>
 and take the accompanying quiz on recognizing parallel form (and 
repairing sentences that ought to use parallel form but don't). Pay 
special attention to the guided tour through the parallel intricacies 
within Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.</p><p>



</p><h2>Coherence Devices in Action</h2>


<table class="shadow" width="89%" bgcolor="white" border="3" cellpadding="6"><tbody><tr>

<span class="table">In our section on writing the <a href="http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/composition/argument.htm"><b>Argumentative Essay</b></a>,
 we have a complete student essay ("Cry, Wolf" &#8212; at the bottom of that 
document) which we have analyzed in terms of argumentative development 
and in which we have paid special attention to the connective devices 
holding ideas together.</span>
</td></tr></tbody></table><br>

<p class="noindent">Look at the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

The ancient Egyptians were masters of preserving dead people's bodies by
 making mummies of them. Mummies several thousand years old have been 
discovered nearly intact. The skin, hair, teeth, fingernails and 
toenails, and facial features of the mummies were evident. It is 
possible to diagnose the disease they suffered in life, such as 
smallpox, arthritis, and nutritional deficiencies. The process was 
remarkably effective. Sometimes apparent were the fatal afflictions of 
the dead people: a middle-aged king died from a blow on the head, and 
polio killed a child king. Mummification consisted of removing the 
internal organs, applying natural preservatives inside and out, and then
 wrapping the body in layers of bandages.</blockquote>



<p>Though weak, this paragraph is not a total washout. It starts with a 
topic sentence, and the sentences that follow are clearly related to the
 topic sentence. In the language of writing, the paragraph is <i>unified</i> (i.e., it contains no irrelevant details). However, the paragraph is not <i>coherent</i>. The sentences are disconnected from each other, making it difficult for the reader to follow the writer's train of thought.</p><p>



</p><p>Below is the same paragraph revised for coherence. <i>Italics</i> indicates pronouns and repeated/restated key words, <b>bold</b> indicates transitional tag-words, and <u>underlining</u> indicates parallel structures.</p>

<blockquote>The ancient Egyptians were masters of preserving dead people's bodies by <i>making mummies</i> of them. <b>In short</b>, <i>mummification</i>
 consisted of removing the internal organs, applying natural 
preservatives inside and out, and then wrapping the body in layers of 
bandages. <b>And</b> <i>the process</i> was remarkably effective. <b>Indeed</b>, <i>mummies</i> several thousand years old have been discovered nearly intact. <i>Their</i> skin, hair, teeth, fingernails and toenails, and facial features <u>are <b>still</b> evident.</u> <i>Their </i> diseases in life, such as smallpox, arthritis, and nutritional deficiencies, <u>are <b>still</b> diagnosable</u>. <b>Even</b> <i>their</i> fatal afflictions <u>are <b>still</b> apparent</u>: a middle-aged king died from a blow on the head; a child king died from polio.</blockquote>

<p>The paragraph is now much more coherent. The organization of the 
information and the links between sentences help readers move easily 
from one sentence to the next. Notice how this writer uses a variety of 
coherence devices, sometimes in combination, to achieve overall 
paragraph coherence.</p>
