 is the glue that holds a piece of writing together. In other words, if a
 paper is cohesive, it sticks together from sentence to sentence and 
from paragraph to paragraph. Cohesive devices certainly include <a href="http://leo.stcloudstate.edu/style/transitioncues.html">transitional words and phrases</a>, such as <i>therefore,</i> <i>furthermore,</i> or <i>for instance,</i>
 that clarify for readers the relationships among ideas in a piece of 
writing. However, transitions aren't enough to make writing cohesive. 
Repetition of key words and use of reference words are also needed for 
cohesion.</p><p></p><center><hr width="25%"></center><p></p><h2>Repetition of Key Words</h2>We
 can tie sentences or paragraphs together by repeating certain key words
 from one sentence to the next or from one paragraph to the next. This 
repetition of key words also helps to emphasize the main idea of a piece
 of writing.<p>For example, in the following paragraph, notice how many times the words <i>owned</i> and <i>ownership</i> are repeated:</p><p></p><center><table width="75%" border="2" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="3"><tbody><tr><td><font size="+1">Nobody <b>owned</b> any part of the <i>land</i>. Sotopo's father <b>owned</b> many cattle, and if the cows continued to produce calves, he might as well become the next chief. Old Grandmother <b>owned</b> the beautifully tanned animal skins she used as coverlets in winter. And Sotopo <b>owned</b> his polished hard-wood assegais. But the <i>land</i>
 belonged to the spirits who governed life; it existed forever, for 
everyone, and was apportioned temporarily according to the dictates of 
the tribal chief and senior headman. Sotopo's father occupied the 
hillside for the time being, and when he died the older son could 
inherit the loan -- <i>land</i>, but no person or family every acquired <b>ownership</b>.</font><p><right>From <b>The Covenant</b> by James Michener.</right></p></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>By repeating the words <i>owned</i> and <i>ownership</i>
 throughout the paragraph, the writer has tied each sentence to each 
other and has clearly indicated what the main idea of the paragraph is. 
In this case, the main idea is <b>ownership</b> of something. And what exactly is being (or not being) <b>owned</b>? By repeating the word <i>land,</i> the author shows us that the entire main idea is <b>ownership of <i>land</i></b>.</p><p></p><center><hr width="25%"></center><p></p><h2>Use of Reference Words</h2>Another
 way of tying sentences and paragraphs together involves using reference
 words that point back to an idea mentioned previously. Among the many 
reference words that can be used to tie one sentence to another or one 
paragraph to another are words like <i>this,</i> <i>these,</i> <i>those,</i> <i>such,</i> and <i>that.</i><p>These
 reference words should not be used by themselves but should be combined
 with the important words and phrases from previous sentences or 
paragraphs. In the following paragraphs, we can see how reference words 
are used not only to tie sentences and paragraphs together, but also to 
emphasize the main idea.</p><p></p><center><table width="75%" border="2" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="3"><tbody><tr><td><font size="+1">Writing a paper is often difficult and many times rewarding. <b>First</b>, I don't always know what to write about, <b>so</b> I often need to research, talk to people, <b>and</b> think about what I know before I come up with a strong topic. <b>In addition</b>,
 writing a paper takes time and energy. Time is needed to select and 
narrow a topic, to generate information and structure ideas, to knock 
out draft after draft, <b>and</b> to edit for my usual typos and mechanical errors. <b>Besides</b> the time involved, energy (and lots of food to produce it) is needed so I can produce my best work. <b>Although</b>
 writing a paper is sometimes difficult, it can be very rewarding. I 
enjoy seeing words which say exactly what I want them to. l <b>also</b> feel proud when everything "clicks." <b>Finally</b>, knowing that I've done my best work and earned a good grade too are strong personal rewards.</font></td></tr></tbody></table></center><p>Many
 words are repeated from one sentence to the next and from one paragraph
 to the next as well. Can you identify the main ideas of each paragraph 
based on the words that are often repeated?</p><p></p><hr><p>
