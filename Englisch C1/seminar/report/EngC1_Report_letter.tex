\opening{Dear Mrs Kilian:}

This is my submission of the written follow-up report on my seminar "Object oriented programming".\smallskip
%I am submitting the background report, "Cerebral Palsy and Its Treatments," that I agreed to write on February 22, 1998.

The report provides a conspectus of object oriented programming and its uses. By covering the basics of \emph{generic} as well as \emph{object oriented programming}, it gives an adequate foundation for understanding the concept of object orientation.\smallskip
%The purpose of this report is to provide useful background on cerebral palsy to physical therapy and physical therapy assistant students. It covers a variety of non-physical therapy treatments and then concludes with an in depth look at the role of physical therapists in managing the condition.

The report will be advantageous for students who are studying computer science or are going to work with computer scientists.
%I hope this report will be helpful for those students that will soon become licensed physical therapists. If you would like to discuss the report with me please let me know.
